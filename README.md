tripping-cyril
==============

Full rewrite of my private internal C++ framework. You can use this framework to easily create a module based event-driven server. As your main binary you will simply need something like https://github.com/schoentoon/tripping-cyril/blob/master/main.cpp which will load your own modules. You may freely create any of your own modules, however if you're making changes to the framework a pull request would be appreciated. Documentation for all the classes of this framework can be found [here](http://schoentoon.github.io/tripping-cyril/).
